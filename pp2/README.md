## Issues

cannot get ssl http request to work through httpclient on ios, works fine on android, i have coded it to ignore ssl errors for ios, not sure if this will affect something
the returned message of logging in is ackward, success is always true, the only way to tell if its a problem is if error has a value






how do you do this in ios
https://components.xamarin.com/gettingstarted/firebaseioscloudmessaging

## Features
created a custom renderer for a NoHelpEntry to use in ios so that it doesnt capitalize and upper case things


## Todo
need to add a test project
make the campus key already be there in a label if it has been saved in properties
how do you code something natively in java/swift and use in the shared code 
UI - activity indicator looks terrible, not a priority
add xamarin insight or some error handling
